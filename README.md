## Overview
Welcome to parks and rec unnoficial API! Finally you can build something cool based on a great TV Show!

With this API you can get information about the characters, the seasons and episodes, and - my favorite best - names for bands that Andy Dwyer made up!

I hope you have a good time using it and creating new things with it!

## URI and Versioning
I hope that other people can also contribute to this API, so version changes may be something that comes in the future. I built the API with this vision and so when you are reaching the API, make sure to include the version. Right now, the version is `v1`, so your endpoints should reach `https://www.parksandrecapi.com/api/v1/<endpoint>`.

## Documentation and Using
First things first, right? To use this API you'll need a Token. I made a token so I can make sure that all people using are actual people and not bots. I will make sure that these can get checked once in a while to deactivate unactive accounts, but that's not yet implemented. 
### Token 
To request a token, go to [https://www.parksandrecapi.com/](https://www.parksandrecapi.com/) and follow the steps. Don't worry, I only ask for an email because I send a confirmation email to make sure the email is real. We won't sell or do anything with it other than things related to the API. Pinky promise.
### Documentation
You can find all the documentation in our [Wiki page]([https://github.com/htedeschi/parks-and-rec-api/wiki](https://github.com/htedeschi/parks-and-rec-api/wiki))! Make sure to check it out to see exactly how it works.
